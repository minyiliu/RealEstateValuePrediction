# RealEstateValuePrediction

In this project, our team is going to predict the value of real estate properties in some large cities that are technology intensive (e.g. San Francisco) in the United States. We aim to provide a measurement and reference of home purchasing/renting. We will test multiple algorithms and deliver a regression/classification model with the best performance.
